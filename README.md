# MazeChallenge_C
## Info
WIP solution for Amazon Maze Challenge from (http://c.adccpt.com/#/challenges/2c9f9f0c545bb87e015494c00b11003c) using C++ and OpenCV.

Currently a bruteforce solution working up till 5x5 grid size due to CPU time constraints.

Idea for this solution is to use opencv and a floodfill to find if a path exists from the top of the maze till the bottom.

Solutions:

3x3 Grid: 78 (different from their solution which states 74) in 0.033s

4x4 Grid: 10814 in 0.622s

5x5 Grid: 5695680 in 317.038s (5m17.038s)

6x6 Grid: .... 

C# logical approach solves 6x6 in < 2h and 5x5 in +-12s. Solution on private repo and busy optimizing for 8x8 solution.
